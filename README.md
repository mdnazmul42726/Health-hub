**Project Description:**

This is a web application project that combines React for the frontend and Firebase for authentication. The project provides a user-friendly interface for users to navigate through various sections of the application, including Home, About, Contact, Blog, and My Purchase. Users can also sign up and log in with email and password or through Google authentication.

The application features a responsive navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience. It includes conditional rendering of navigation links and user profile options based on the user's authentication status. When a user is logged in, they can access their profile information and log out securely.
