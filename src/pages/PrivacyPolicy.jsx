            <p> Your personal data is information which, by itself or with other information available to us, can be used to identify a person directly or indirectly.

                We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymised or aggregated so that it can no longer be used to identify a person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.

                The collection and use of your personal data is regulated under the UK Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act) and the 2018 General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and we process your data in accordance with these regulations as both a data controller and a data processor.

            <p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for.

                To determine the appropriate retention period for the personal information we hold, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the reasons why we handle your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
